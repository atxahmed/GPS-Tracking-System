# GPS-Tracking-System
A gps tracking system to indicate how close you are to destination point using gps module and Tiva C microcontroller.
The system uses UART protocol to get Coordinates from GPS NEO 6m and then decode the nema sentence to get the read coordinates.
The Project was build on storing the calculated distance between the current point and destination point and using it as input to indicators (LED & BUZZER) .
